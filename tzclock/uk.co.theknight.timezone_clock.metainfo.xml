    <p>
      TzClock is an analogue desktop Clock that can display the time around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time zone information is read from the system, this means that as the time zone information is updated by the system repositories the clock is also updated. Once you have configured the clock as you like it all the settings can be saved.
